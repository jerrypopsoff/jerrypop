          In 2013 my interest in popcorn was sparked when my college roommate’s
          parents bought us ten pounds of kernels, and we challenged ourselves
          to use the entire supply before finals. After experimenting with
          flavors I discovered popcorn was a healthier alternative to junk food,
          and I continued inventing new varieties on my journey to losing 130
          pounds.

          In 2015 I earned the nickname <i>Jerrypop</i> among friends for
          showing up to every gathering with a bold new flavor of handcrafted
          popcorn, such as PB&J or Habanero Ranch.
